"The purpose of this first part is to present the use of F# (pronounced “F Sharp”) programming language to facilitate and automate a wide variety of data manipulation\n",
"tasks typically faced in life science research. Here, we want to support your coding literacy by a practical programming approach without the attempt to detail every \n",
"possible variation of the mechanisms. This offers a rapid introduction to F# programming that should allow you to understand code and do some manipulation to achieve \n",
"your desired outcome.\n",
"\n",
"There are many kinds of programming languages, with different purposes, styles, intended uses, etc. However, F# is particularly nice as it is easy to learn in the beginning \n",
"but also extremely powerful for professional use cases. Simply put, F# is a beautiful language. It is effective for everything from teaching new programmers to advanced\n",
"computer science study, from simple scripts to sophisticated advanced applications. Therefore, it is extremely well suited for bioinformatics programming and \n",
"application in live science.\n",

"Definitely, F# can be a good friend in your daily work even when you are doing simple calculations e.g., in the lab. Let’s jump right in and some stuff done:\n",
