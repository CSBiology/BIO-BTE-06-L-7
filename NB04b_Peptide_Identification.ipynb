"## Understanding peptide identification from MS2 spectra\n",
"\n",
"Under low-energy fragmentation conditions, peptide fragment patterns are reproducible and, in general, predictable, which allows for an \n",
"amino acid sequence identification according to a fragmentation expectation. Algorithms for peptide identification perform in principle \n",
"three basic tasks:\n",
"\n",
"**(i)** a raw data preprocessing step is applied to the MS/MS spectra to obtain clean peak information. The same signal filtering \n",
"and background subtraction methods are used as discussed in the section of low-level processing. Peak detection, however, may be performed \n",
"differently. Preprocessing of MS/MS spectra focuses on the extraction of the precise m/z of the peak rather than the accurate peak areas. \n",
"The conversion of a peak profile into the corresponding m/z and intensity values reduces the complexity, its representation is termed centroiding. \n",
"To extract the masses for identification in a simple and fast way, peak fitting approaches are used. These approaches take either the most intense \n",
"point of the peak profile, fit a Lorentzian distribution to the profile, or use a quadratic fit. \n",
"\n",
"**(ii)** Spectrum information and possible amino acid sequences assignments are evaluated. \n",
"\n",
"**(iii)** The quality of the match between spectrum and possible sequences is scored.\n",
"\n",
"Even though the three steps roughly describe the basic principle of algorithms used for peptide sequence identification, most implementations \n",
"show differences in individual steps which can lead to major changes in the outcome. Therefore, it has been proven useful to utilize more than \n",
"one algorithm for a robust and thorough identification. Due to their major difference in identification strategies and prerequisites, \n",
"identification algorithms are normally classified into three categories: (i) *de novo* peptide sequencing, (ii) peptide sequence-tag (PST) \n",
"searching, and (iii) uninterpreted sequence searching. However, in this notebook we focus on the explanation of (iii) uninterpreted sequence \n",
"searching, the most frequently used methods.\n",

"**Figure 6: Process of computational identification of peptides from their fragment spectra**\n",
"\n",
"Previously we learned, that peptides fragment to create patterns characteristic of a specific amino acid sequence. These patterns are reproducible and, in general, \n",
"predictable taking the applied fragmentation method into account. This can be used for computational identification of peptides from their fragment spectra. \n",
"This process can be subdivided into 5 main steps: spectrum preprocessing, selection of possible sequences, generating theoretical spectra, matching and scoring \n",
"(Figure 6). The first step is a preprocessing of the experimental spectra and is done to reduce noise. Secondly, all possible amino acid \n",
"sequences are selected which match the particular precursor peptide mass. The possible peptides can but do not need to be restricted to a particular organism. \n",
"A theoretical spectrum is predicted for each of these amino acid sequences. Matching and scoring is performed by comparing experimental spectra to their predicted \n",
"corresponding theoretical spectra. The score function measures the closeness of fit between the experimental acquired and theoretical spectrum. There are many \n",
"different score functions, which can be considered as the main reason of different identifications considering different identification algorithm. The most \n",
"natural score function is the cross correlation score (xcorr) used by the commercially available search tool SEQUEST. One of the reasons the xcorr is so \n",
"sensitive is because it involves a correction factor that assesses the background correlation for each acquired spectrum and the theoretically predicted \n",
"spectrum from sequences within a database. To compute this correction factor, a measure of similarity is calculated at different offsets between a preprocessed \n",
"mass spectrum and a theoretical spectrum. The final xcorr is then the correlation at zero offset minus the mean correlation from all the individual offsets.\n",
"\n",
"Thus, the correlation function measures the coherence of two signals by, in effect, translating one signal across the other. This can be mathematically \n",
"achieved using the formula for cross-correlation in the form for discrete input signals:\n",
"\n",
"***Equation 5***\n",
"\n",
"![](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?\\large\u0026space;R_{\\tau}\u0026space;=\u0026space;\\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}x_{i}\\cdot%20y_{i\u0026plus;\\tau})\n",
"\n",
"where x(i) is a peak of the reconstructed spectrum at position i and y(i) is a peak of the experimental spectrum. The displacement value ùúè \n",
"is the amount by which the signal is offset during the translation and is varied over a range of values. If two signals are the same, the correlation \n",
"function should have its maxima at ùúè=0, where there is no offset. The average of the offset-correlation is seen as the average background correlation \n",
"and needs to be subtracted from the correlation at ùúè=0. It follows: \n",
"\n",
"***Equation 6***\n",
"\n",

"\n",
"In practice many theoretical spectra have to be matched again a single experimental spectrum. Therefore, the calculation can be speed up by reformulating Equation 5 and Equation 6 and introduce a preprocessing step, which is independent of the predicted spectra.\n",
