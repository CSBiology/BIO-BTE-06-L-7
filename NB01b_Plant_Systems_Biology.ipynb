"## Plant Systems Biology\n",
"\n",
"The general paradigm of Systems Biology clearly applies to plants, as they represent complex biological systems. \n",
"The functioning of a plant as a biological system is the result of a combination of multiple intertwined and dynamic interactions between its components. \n",
"In addition, most plants are sessile systems that have to face fluctuating environmental conditions, including biotic and abiotic stresses (Ruffel et al. 2010).\n",
"The process of a biological system responding to changes in environmental conditions is termed acclimation. These molecular physiological responses represent a complex \n",
"dynamic adjustment of the interplay between genes, proteins and metabolites that allows the organism to acclimate to the changing environment. \n",
"The ability to acclimate ensures the survival of all living organisms and is therefore fundamental for the understanding of biological systems. \n",
"Detailed knowledge about how plants acclimate to a changing environment is crucial especially in times of global climate changes, \n",
"as plants are of great importance for our quality of life as a key source of food, shelter, fiber, medicine, and fuel (Minorsky 2003).\n",
"\n",
"The prominent model plant *Arabidopsis thaliana* is well suited for plant Systems Biology studies because sophisticated experimental tools and extensive data \n",
"collections are readily available (Van Norman et al. 2009). However, the importance of a model organism is not only coined by the availability of molecular \n",
"tools to manipulate the organism, but also by its agricultural and economic impact like in the cases of tobacco, rice, maize or \n",
"barley (P√£curar 2009). Also microalgae are of special economic interest due to their potential as biofuel producers (Cagnon et al. 2013). \n",
"Additionally, the use of organisms with lower biological complexity facilitates the feasibility of System Biology studies and is an important factor to consider \n",
"for the choice of a suitable model organism in Systems Biology.\n",
"\n",
"The eukaryotic green alga *Chlamydomonas reinhardtii* is particularly well suited for plant Systems Biology approaches. \n",
"This unicellular freshwater and soil-dwelling alga has a single, cup-shaped chloroplast with a photosynthetic apparatus that is similar to \n",
"that of higher plants (Eberhard et al. 2008, Merchant et al. 2007). Hence, results gained on photosynthesis processes in *Chlamydomonas* \n",
"are likely to be transferable to higher plants. The nuclear, mitochondrial, and chloroplast genomes have been sequenced and tools for manipulating them \n",
"are available (Merchant et al. 2007). *Chlamydomonas* cells have a size of ~10 ¬µm and grow under photo-, mixo-, and heterotrophic conditions \n",
"with a generation time of ~5-8 h (Harris, 2008). *Chlamydomonas* can be maintained under controlled conditions and environmental \n",
"changes can be applied homogeneously and rapidly to all cells in a liquid culture. In contrast to multicellular organisms there are no influences by \n",
"tissue heterogeneity. Even the influence of different cell cycle stages may be ruled out by performing experiments with asynchronous cell cultures \n",
"(Bruggeman and Westerhoff 2007, Harris 2001). Finally, gene families in *Chlamydomonas* have fewer members than those in higher plants thus facilitating the \n",
"interpretation of results involving many genes/proteins (Merchant et al. 2007).\n",
"\n",
"## Modeling growth\n",
"\n",
"In order to solve real world tasks more convenient, F# provides a huge collection of additional programming libraries. \n",
"Anything that extends beyond the basics must be written by a user. If the chunk of code is useful to multiple different users, \n",
"it\u0027s often put into a library to make it easily reusable. A library is a collection of related pieces of code that have been compiled \n",
"and stored together in a single file and can than be used an included. The most important libraries in F# for bioinformatics are:\n",
"\n",
"\n",
"* [BioFSharp](https://csbiology.github.io/BioFSharp/): Open source bioinformatics and computational biology toolbox written in F#\n",
"* [FSharp.Stats](https://github.com/fslaborg/FSharp.Stats): F# project for statistical computing\n",
"* [Plotly.NET](https://github.com/plotly/Plotly.NET): .NET interface for plotly.js written in F# üìà\n",
"\n",
"\n",
"The first real world use case of F# in Systems Biology is to model growth for a defined cell number to see possible overexpression effects. \n",
"Biologists often utilize growth experiments to analyze basic properties of a given organism or cellular model. For a solid comparison of data \n",
"obtained from different experiments and to investigate the speciÔ¨Åc effect of a given experimental set up, modeling the growth is needed after recording the data. \n",
"\n",
"This notebook introduces the most classical way to model growth of *Chlamydomonas reinhardtii* or any other growth data using F#.\n",
"\n",
"Now, let\u0027s get started by loading the required libraries first.\n",

"To derive the slope required for the doubling time calculation, the measured growth data points have to be modelled. \n",

"In the case above there are two coefficients to be identified: The slope m and the y-intercept b. But how can the best fitting coefficients be determined?\n",
"\n",
"Therefore a quality measure called ***Residual Sum of Squares (RSS)*** is used. It describes the discrepancy of the measured points \n",
"and the corresponding estimation model. If the discrepancy is small, the RSS is small too.\n",
"\n",
"In regression analysis the optimal set of coefficients (m and b) that [minimizes the RSS is searched](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/LeastSquaresFitting.html).\n",
"\n",
"If there is no straightforward way to identify the RSS-minimizing coefficient set, then the problem is part of nonlinear regression. \n",
