1. Making sense of sequences
    1. Strings have their own module 
    2. Build a map to associate values with a key
    3. Bio-collections are F# collections
    4. All collections have their modules 
2. Higher-order functions     
    1. Functions can consume other functions
    2. Pipe-forward operator |> 
3. More interesting types 
    1. Tuples are ad hoc data structures 
    2. Record types provide more organization
