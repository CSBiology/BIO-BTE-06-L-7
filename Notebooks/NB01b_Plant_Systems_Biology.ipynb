        "The general paradigm of Systems Biology clearly applies to plants, as they represent complex biological systems. \n",
        "The functioning of a plant as a biological system is the result of a combination of multiple intertwined and dynamic interactions between its components. \n",
        "In addition, most plants are sessile systems that have to face fluctuating environmental conditions, including biotic and abiotic stresses (Ruffel et al. 2010).\n",
        "The process of a biological system responding to changes in environmental conditions is termed acclimation. These molecular physiological responses represent a complex \n",
        "dynamic adjustment of the interplay between genes, proteins and metabolites that allows the organism to acclimate to the changing environment. \n",
        "The ability to acclimate ensures the survival of all living organisms and is therefore fundamental for the understanding of biological systems. \n",
        "Detailed knowledge about how plants acclimate to a changing environment is crucial especially in times of global climate changes, \n",
        "as plants are of great importance for our quality of life as a key source of food, shelter, fiber, medicine, and fuel (Minorsky 2003).\n",
        "\n",
        "The prominent model plant *Arabidopsis thaliana* is well suited for plant Systems Biology studies because sophisticated experimental tools and extensive data \n",
        "collections are readily available (Van Norman et al. 2009). However, the importance of a model organism is not only coined by the availability of molecular \n",
        "tools to manipulate the organism, but also by its agricultural and economic impact like in the cases of tobacco, rice, maize or \n",
        "barley (Pãcurar 2009). Also microalgae are of special economic interest due to their potential as biofuel producers (Cagnon et al. 2013). \n",
        "Additionally, the use of organisms with lower biological complexity facilitates the feasibility of System Biology studies and is an important factor to consider \n",
        "for the choice of a suitable model organism in Systems Biology.\n",
        "\n",
        "The eukaryotic green alga *Chlamydomonas reinhardtii* is particularly well suited for plant Systems Biology approaches. \n",
        "This unicellular freshwater and soil-dwelling alga has a single, cup-shaped chloroplast with a photosynthetic apparatus that is similar to \n",
        "that of higher plants (Eberhard et al. 2008, Merchant et al. 2007). Hence, results gained on photosynthesis processes in *Chlamydomonas* \n",
        "are likely to be transferable to higher plants. The nuclear, mitochondrial, and chloroplast genomes have been sequenced and tools for manipulating them \n",
        "are available (Merchant et al. 2007). *Chlamydomonas* cells have a size of ~10 µm and grow under photo-, mixo-, and heterotrophic conditions \n",
        "with a generation time of ~5-8 h (Harris, 2008). *Chlamydomonas* can be maintained under controlled conditions and environmental \n",
        "changes can be applied homogeneously and rapidly to all cells in a liquid culture. In contrast to multicellular organisms there are no influences by \n",
        "tissue heterogeneity. Even the influence of different cell cycle stages may be ruled out by performing experiments with asynchronous cell cultures \n",
        "(Bruggeman and Westerhoff 2007, Harris 2001). Finally, gene families in *Chlamydomonas* have fewer members than those in higher plants thus facilitating the \n",
        "interpretation of results involving many genes/proteins (Merchant et al. 2007).\n",
