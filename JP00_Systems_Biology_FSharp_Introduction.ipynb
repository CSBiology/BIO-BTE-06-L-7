"## Systems Biology: A brief introduction\n",
"\n",
"\n",
"The term “systems theory” was introduced by the biologist L. von Bertalanffy. He defined a system as a set of related components that work together in a particular environment to perform whatever \n",
"functions are required to achieve the system\u0027s objective (Bertalanffy 1945). The hierarchical organization orchestrating the interaction of thousands of molecules with individual \n",
"properties allows complex biological functions. Biological processes like cell division, biomass production, or a systemic response to perturbations are molecular physiological functions \n",
"which result from a complex dynamic interplay between genes, proteins and metabolites (Figure 1). To gain a holistic understanding of a biological system, all parts of the \n",
"system need to be studied simultaneously by quantitative measures (Sauer et al. 2007). The focus on a system-wide perspective lies on the quantitative understanding of the \n",
"organizational structure, functional state, robustness and dynamics of a biological system and led to the coining of the term “Systems Biology”(Kitano 2002a).\n",
"\n",
"The current challenges of Systems Biology approaches are mainly along four lines (Sauer et al. 2007, Joyce and Palsson 2006): \n",
"\n",
" - (**i**) - system-wide quantification of transcriptome, proteome (including protein modifications) and metabolome\n",
" \n",
" - (**ii**) - identification of physical interactions between these components\n",
" \n",
" - (**iii**) - inference of structure, type and quantity of found interactions\n",
" \n",
" - (**iv**) - analysis and integration of the resulting large amounts of heterogeneous data. It becomes obvious that an interdisciplinary effort is needed to resolve these challenges in Systems Biology (Aderem 2006). Here Biology dictates which analytical, experimental and computational methods are required.\n",
"\n",
"Modern analytical methods to measure the identity and quantity of biomolecules system-wide, summarized under the term “quantitative omics”-technologies, address the first two \n",
"mentioned challenges of Systems Biology. Among these “omics”-technologies are transcriptomics based on microarrays/next generation sequencing and proteomics/metabolomics based on mass-spectrometry.\n",
"\n",
"Tying in with the area of genome sequencing, the focus is set on the accurate profiling of gene/protein expression and metabolite concentrations, as well as on the determination of biological \n",
"protein modifications and of physical interactions between proteins.\n",
"\n",
"Addressing the abovementioned challenges three and four of Systems Biology, the development of numerous computational approaches reaches out to unravel the \n",
"intrinsic complexity of biological systems (Kahlem and Birney 2006). These computational approaches focus on knowledge discovery and on in silico \n",
"simulation or modeling (Kitano 2002b). In the latter approach knowledge on a biological process is converted into a mathematical model. \n",
"In silico simulations based on such a model can provide predictions that may subsequently be tested experimentally. Computation-based knowledge discovery \n",
"(also known as data mining) aims to extract hidden patterns from complex and high-dimensional data to generate hypotheses. Therefore, the first step is to describe \n",
"information on a biological system such that it is sustainably stored in a format rendering it readable and manipulable for machines and humans. The second step is \n",
"to integrate the huge amount of differently structured data, often referred to as the “big data” challenge. In a last step, statistical or machine learning methods \n",
"are applied to extract the information or underlying principles hidden in the data.\n",
"\n",
"The most flexible way of working with huge amounts of data is using a lightweight programming language with a succinct syntax. Therefore, it becomes necessary that biologist become familiar with a suitable programming language to solve real world problems in (Systems) Biology.\n",

"## Starting with FSharp\n",
"\n",
"\n",
"F# (pronounced “F Sharp”) is a simple and expressive programming language. It can be described as statically typed impure functional language that supports functional, \n",
"imperative and object-oriented paradigm and also several other programming styles including data-driven, event-driven and parallel programming. \n",
"This makes it an excellent tool for introducing programming as well as programming paradigms.\n",
"\n",
"F# is supported by the [F# Software Foundation](http://fsharp.org) and a worldwide community of contributors. Microsoft and other companies \n",
"develop professional tooling for F#. The [F# Language Reference](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/articles/fsharp/) is a reference for \n",
"the F# language, and the [F# Guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/articles/fsharp/) covers general topics. There are lots of excellent \n",
"[F# learning resources](http://fsharp.org/learn.html) available online.\n",
"   \n",
"To learn more about how to use Jupyter notebooks, see the [Jupyter documentation](http://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/) and the [Jupyter keyboard shortcuts](https://www.cheatography.com/weidadeyue/cheat-sheets/jupyter-notebook/). You can find more information baoutthe F# and Jupyter tooling locally using [IfSharp](https://github.com/fsprojects/IfSharp).\n",
"  \n",
"With the help of the following FSharp coding information/examples, you will be able to solve all exercises in *JP01_FSharpExcercises.ipynb*!\n",
"   \n",
"Let\u0027s start with our basic introduction:\n",
"\n",
"## Functions\n",
"\n",
"The impetus behind functional programming comes from mathematics. Mathematical functions have a number of very nice features that functional languages try to emulate in the real world.\n",
"So first, let’s start with a mathematical function that adds 1 to a number.\n",
"\n",
"```\n",
"Add1(x) = x+1\n",
"```\n",
"\n",
"What does this really mean? Well it seems pretty straightforward. It means that there is an operation that starts with a number, and adds one to it.\n",
"   \n",
"**Let’s introduce some terminology:**\n",
"\n",
" - The set of values that can be used as input to the function is called the domain. In this case, it could be the set of real numbers, but to make life simpler for now, let’s restrict it to integers only.\n",
"\n",
" - The set of possible output values from the function is called the range (technically, the image on the codomain). In this case, it is also the set of integers.\n",
"\n",
" - The function is said to map the domain to the range.\n",
"\n",
"A diagram of a general function would be:\n",

"## Binding function values and simple values\n",

"The process of using a name to represent a function or a value is called “binding“. A binding is done by using the `let` keyword in F#. Let’s look at the simple function we used previously:\n",
