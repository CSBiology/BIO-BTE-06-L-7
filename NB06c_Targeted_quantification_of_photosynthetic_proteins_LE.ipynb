"The amount of measured 15N QProtein quantities can, even if you pipette perfectly, vary due to a faulty label efficiency.\n",
"The label efficiency is an indicator on how many atoms of the designated type (here 15N) are in fact their stable isotope.\n",
"A lower label efficiency will lead to lower quantities of the measured labeled peptides, as they will be detected on other m/z values than the predicted ones.\n",
